          Haji Ali Dargah is one of the most iconic religious places in Mumbai,
          located on an islet off the coast of Worli. This Indo-Islamic
          architectural wonder attracts thousands of visitors daily from all
          faiths.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Built in 1431, the dargah contains the tomb of Sayed Peer Haji Ali
          Shah Bukhari. According to legends, Haji Ali died during his
          pilgrimage to Mecca and his casket miraculously floated back to this
          spot in Mumbai.
        </p>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          The structure showcases brilliant Indo-Islamic architecture, featuring
          intricate marble pillars, mirrors, and colorful glass work. The
          85-foot-high minaret adds to its magnificent appearance. The dargah is
          connected to the mainland by a narrow causeway, which gets submerged
          during high tide.
