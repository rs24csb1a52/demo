          Banganga Tank is an ancient water tank located in the Walkeshwar
          Temple Complex in Malabar Hill. This sacred site is a remarkable
          reminder of Mumbai's ancient history, dating back to the 12th century.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          According to legend, Lord Rama stopped here during his journey to
          Lanka. When he needed water, he shot an arrow into the ground,
          creating a tributary of the Ganges, hence the name Banganga (Baan
          means arrow, Ganga refers to the River Ganges).
        </p>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          The tank is surrounded by steps (ghats) made of stone, with numerous
          temples and shrines lining its perimeter. The rectangular tank
          measures 120 meters by 40 meters and is an excellent example of
          ancient Indian architecture and engineering. The surrounding area
          features traditional Indian architectural elements, including carved
          stone temples and dharamshalas (rest houses).
