          The Gateway of India is an arch monument built during the 20th century
          in Bombay, India. The monument was erected to commemorate the landing
          of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder when they visited
          India in 1911.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The foundation stone was laid on 31 March 1911, and the structure was
          completed in 1924. The Gateway was later used as a symbolic ceremonial
          entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay.
        </p>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          The structure is an arch made of basalt, 26 meters (85 feet) high. The
          architectural style combines elements of the Roman triumphal arch and
          traditional Hindu and Muslim architectural styles.
