          The Elephanta Caves, located on Elephanta Island in Mumbai Harbor, are
          a UNESCO World Heritage site known for their impressive rock-cut
          sculptures and cave temples. Dating back to the 5th-7th centuries,
          these caves are dedicated primarily to Lord Shiva and showcase the
          remarkable artistry of ancient Indian craftsmen.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          According to legend, the caves were originally created by the Pandavas
          from the Mahabharata during their exile. Another belief suggests that
          they were built by the demon king Banasura as a tribute to Lord Shiva.
          The caves later came under the rule of various dynasties, including
          the Mauryas and Chalukyas, before being rediscovered by the Portuguese
          in the 16th century, who named the island "Elephanta" after finding a
          large elephant sculpture at the site.
        </p>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          The Elephanta Caves consist of a series of rock-hewn caves featuring
          intricate sculptures, grand pillars, and detailed carvings. The most
          prominent among them is the Great Cave, which houses the iconic
          20-foot-tall Trimurti sculpture depicting the three aspects of Lord
          Shivaâ€”Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer. The caves also contain
          various panels illustrating mythological events, finely carved walls,
          and spacious courtyards, showcasing a blend of Hindu and Buddhist
          influences in their architectural style.
