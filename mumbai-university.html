            <p>The University of Mumbai, established in 1857, is one of the oldest and most prestigious educational institutions in India. Its iconic Victorian Gothic architecture makes it a significant heritage site in Mumbai.</p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The university was established in 1857 during the British rule and was one of the first three universities in India. It was modeled after similar universities in the United Kingdom, particularly the University of London.</p>
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>The university's main building, Convocation Hall, and Rajabai Clock Tower are prime examples of Victorian Gothic architecture.
